the gmod CS:O / Nexon:Zombie guns are really fun but really overpowered for pvp

this rebalance aims to make the guns viable & fun for pvp
- has a slightly higher ttk than CS:S
- some guns were removed (sorry dark night expert enjoyers...) because they were redundant
- most guns should be viable -- i.e., a "simple" rifle should still be able to compete against a """fancy""" rifle.
